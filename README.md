# One Two Three Happy

This project is my first attempt at building a React app so I am using it as a test before building bigger, more complex, things.

## SASS

For all of my projects I use a Global SASS library called [__sass](https://github.com/BinaryMoon/__sass). By keeping the code separate I can fix problems in a centralized location.

I compile the SASS with Codekit. I could use Gulp/ npm but I find this easier, and one less set of code to maintain.
